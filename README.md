1. cutting board: old versions of the TM8 that didn't make it to the final thing, but I kept anyways just cuz
2. side projects: projects developed along with the TM8, such as the USB IR key or Flash Modchip
3. random stuff: random files like fonts and drawings for graphics design, simple mockups, etc.
